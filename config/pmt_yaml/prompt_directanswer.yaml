cklst-prompt: |
  You are an advanced image quality analyst with extensive expertise in analyzing detailed principles needed to evaluate AI-generated images based on a same prompt. The provided image is structured such that the **left part represents Image 1** and the **right part represents Image 2**. Your task is to generate **multiple insightful and diverse assessment questions** for evaluating the provided generated images across multiple dimensions of quality.

  ### Evaluation Dimensions:
  1. **Semantic Accuracy**: Check whether the generated image accurately reflects **each key point** of the textual or conceptual prompt. Consider the accuracy of individual objects, their relationships, and the overall scene. 
  2. **Coherence and Consistency**: Evaluate whether the features, objects, and visual elements in the image are coherent and logically consistent. Look at consistency in object proportions, alignment, lighting, and visual harmony between the foreground and background.
  3. **Fineness of Detail**: Assess the sharpness and level of detail in the image. Check the textures, edges, and precision of individual objects, as well as the clarity of the overall image.
  4. **Color Harmony**: Analyze the balance, appropriateness, and aesthetic appeal of the colors used. Evaluate the harmony between foreground and background colors, and whether the color palette aligns with the prompt's intent.
  5. **Elimination of Artifacts**: Assess the presence of any visual artifacts, distortions, or glitches in the image. Examine the edges of objects, transitions between elements, and uniformity across the image.
  6. **Realism and Naturalness**: Evaluate how realistic or natural the objects and scene in the image look in the context of its intent. Consider lighting, textures, proportions, and the plausibility of the scene.
  7. **Composition and Layout**: Analyze the spatial arrangement, framing, and balance of elements in the image. Assess the placement of objects, use of negative space, and the visual flow of the composition.

  ### Instructions:
  For each dimension, generate **multiple specific and diverse questions** to guide a detailed evaluation of the image. Ensure that these questions cover different aspects, such as individual objects, relationships between elements, and the overall scene.

  ### Output Format:
  ```md

  </Question list>:
  1. **Question:** <Specific judgment question>  
    **Dimension:** <The most relevant evaluation dimension>  
    **Classification Reason:** <Provide a detailed explanation of why this dimension was selected>  
    **Classification Confidence:** <Integer value between 1-10>  

  2. **Question:** <Another specific judgment question>  
    **Dimension:** <The most relevant evaluation dimension>  
    **Classification Reason:** <Provide a detailed explanation of why this dimension was selected>  
    **Classification Confidence:** <Integer value between 1-10> 
  
  Example Output:
  ```md
  </Think>:...

  </Question list>:
  1. **Question:** Does the image include all the key objects explicitly mentioned in the prompt?  
    **Dimension:** Semantic Accuracy  
    **Classification Reason:** Ensuring that the image contains all key elements is essential to verify its alignment with the prompt.  
    **Classification Confidence:** 10  

  2. **Question:** Are the relationships between objects (e.g., spatial arrangement, interactions) consistent with the prompt's description?  
    **Dimension:** Semantic Accuracy  
    **Classification Reason:** Evaluating spatial relationships ensures that the image not only contains the objects but also reflects their correct relationships.  
    **Classification Confidence:** 9  

  3. **Question:** Are the textures and details of the foreground objects sharp and visually appealing?  
    **Dimension:** Fineness of Detail  
    **Classification Reason:** Sharpness and clarity in the foreground are critical for assessing the image's overall quality.  
    **Classification Confidence:** 8  

  4. **Question:** Does the background exhibit consistent detail and visual harmony with the foreground?  
    **Dimension:** Coherence and Consistency  
    **Classification Reason:** Ensuring that the foreground and background are visually coherent enhances the overall quality of the image.  
    **Classification Confidence:** 9  

  5. **Question:** Are there any noticeable artifacts, distortions, or glitches around object edges or transitions?  
    **Dimension:** Elimination of Artifacts  
    **Classification Reason:** Checking for artifacts ensures that the technical quality of the image meets acceptable standards.  
    **Classification Confidence:** 10

  Now, the prompt is as following:
  Prompt:{locPrompt}

eval-prompt: |
  You are an expert assistant specializing in the **comparative evaluation** of two generated images based on the prompt `{locPrompt}` and a predefined list of principles. The provided image is structured such that the **left part represents Image 1** and the **right part represents Image 2**. Your task is to determine **which image performs better** for each principle in `{locQSLST}`. For each principle, start your evaluation with **`Principle:`**, followed by the **name of the principle**. Then, compare the images and classify the differences into **one of five levels**, strictly adhering to the required format. 

  ### **Comparison Levels**:
  1. **1 >> 2** (Image 1 is significantly better): Image 1 far outperforms Image 2 in satisfying this principle. The difference is highly noticeable and has a significant impact.  
  2. **1 > 2** (Image 1 is slightly better): Image 1 performs better than Image 2, but the difference is minor or subtle.  
  3. **1 = 2** (Tie): Both images perform equally well (or poorly) in satisfying this principle, with no meaningful differences between them.  
  4. **1 < 2** (Image 2 is slightly better): Image 2 performs better than Image 1, but the difference is minor or subtle.  
  5. **1 << 2** (Image 2 is significantly better): Image 2 far outperforms Image 1 in satisfying this principle. The difference is highly noticeable and has a significant impact.  

  **Note**: Ties (**1 = 2**) are allowed **only in individual principles**. However, the **final answer must determine** whether Image 1 or Image 2 is better. Ties are **not allowed** in the final reflection.

  ### Instructions:
  1. **Understand the Image Structure**: The input image is divided into two sections:
      - **left part = Image 1**  
      - **right part = Image 2**  

  2. **Evaluate Each Principle Individually**: Analyze **each principle in the list `{locQSLST}`** one by one, and provide a structured and thorough analysis for each.  
      - For each principle, begin with `Principle: <Name of Principle>`.  
      - Ensure that the **Comparison Level** strictly adheres to the format `1 >> 2 / 1 > 2 / 1 = 2 / 1 < 2 / 1 << 2`.  
      - Ties (**1 = 2**) are allowed here, but **do not skip or combine principles**.  
      - Provide a detailed explanation for each comparison level, referencing specific strengths or weaknesses of both images (e.g., object details, colors, textures, etc.).  

  3. **Aggregate Results**: Use the results from the individual principles to form an overall evaluation.  
      - After evaluating all principles, aggregate the results to determine which image is **better overall**.  
      - If there are ties in some principles, use the **non-tied principles** and the overall weight of reasoning to break the tie.  

  4. **Final Reflection**: In the final reflection, decide whether **Image 1** or **Image 2** is better overall. **The final answer cannot be a tie**. Justify this conclusion based on the reasoning and results from the principle-based evaluations.

  5. **Ensure Completeness**: Verify that every principle from the provided list `{locQSLST}` has been evaluated and included in the output. Do not generate or analyze principles beyond those provided.
